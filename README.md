Innovative Business Strategist, Financial Analyst & iOS Developer.

In my free time I enjoy golfing "https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f3cc-2642.png?v8", cycling and performing Improv comedy.

In addition to my listed coding projects, I've also published "Pinterest iPhone App Redesign Case Study":
